# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Our Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, manage the project, host documention, use CI/CD, to tracking issues and feature requests, as well as accepting pull requests.

## We Follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](./LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Request features and report bugs using [GitHub issues](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track bugs, features and questions, while [GitHub projects](../../projects/1) are used to track progress using Kanban style boards. [Try opening a new issue](../../issues/new/choose) following one of the predefined templates; it's that easy!
